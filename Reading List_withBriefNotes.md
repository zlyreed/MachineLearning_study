-[No, Machine Learning is not just glorified Statistics](https://towardsdatascience.com/no-machine-learning-is-not-just-glorified-statistics-26d3952234e3?source=emailShare-17a8687279ce-1547271903&_branch_match_id=613367988687238058)
 - Machine Learning Does Not Require An Advanced Knowledge of Statistics
 - Machine Learning = Representation + Evaluation + Optimization: Once you have the evaluation component, you can optimize the representation function in order to improve your evaluation metric. In neural networks, this usually means using some variant of stochastic gradient descent to update the weights and biases of your network according to some defined loss function. 
 - Regression Over 100 Million Variablesâ€”No Problem: The VGG-16 ConvNet architecture, for example, has approximately 138 million parameters.
