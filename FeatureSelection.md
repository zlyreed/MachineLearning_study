## Feature selection
-[Why, How and When to apply Feature Selection](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-how-and-when-to-apply-feature-selection-e9c69adfabf2)

Feature Selection is a very critical component in a Data Scientistâ€™s workflow. When presented data with very high dimensionality, models usually choke because
1. Training time increases exponentially with number of features.
2. Models have increasing risk of overfitting with increasing number of features.

Three feature selection techniques:
1. Filter Methods
2. Wrapper Methods
3. Embedded Methods.
