# MachineLearning_study
I am trying to collect online materials to learn machine learning. The information on this repository was collected from: 

Github
* [Amazing Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) (by josephmisiti)
* [Getting started with machine learning](https://github.com/collections/machine-learning) (by Omoju Miller)

Others
* [Data Science and Robot (blog)](https://brohrer.github.io/blog.html) (by Brandon Rohrer)
* [AndrewNg_machinelearning Notes (斯坦福大学2014（吴恩达）机器学习教程中文笔记)](https://github.com/fengdu78/Coursera-ML-AndrewNg-Notes) (by fengdu78)

Workshops:
* Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center [(PSC)](https://www.psc.edu):
  - The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) is supported by the National Science Foundation:
    - [the overview of XSEDE training](https://portal.xsede.org/training/overview)
	- [On Demand Training](https://portal.xsede.org/online-training)
	
* Summer Workshop on Machine Learning [(May 25-26, 2019):](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/seminars-and-conferences/machine-learning-workshop/index.html)
  - The CMU Summer Workshop on Machine Learning is intended to introduce junior researchers to the cutting-edge machine learning methods and their applications in the marketing and information systems research, and open up common ground for future discussions among researchers who are using or wish to use machine learning methods in their research.
